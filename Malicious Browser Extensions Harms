 How Malicious Browser Extensions Can Harm Users
1. Stealing Sensitive Data
Malicious extensions can read everything you type or view, including:

Passwords

Credit card numbers

Personal emails or messages

Especially dangerous if they have access to “read and change all your data on all websites”.

2. Tracking Browsing Activity
Extensions can secretly track:

Browsing history

Search queries

Website visits

This data can be sold to advertisers or used for profiling.

3. Injecting Ads or Redirects
Some extensions insert unwanted ads, banners, or popups.

Others redirect users to malicious or phishing sites, tricking them into entering sensitive data.

4. Installing Malware
Extensions can download and execute malicious code.

This may lead to:

Keyloggers (tracking what you type)

Ransomware

Backdoors into your system

5. Hijacking Accounts or Sessions
If an extension captures authentication tokens or cookies, it can hijack:

Social media sessions

Email access

Cloud storage accounts

6. Changing Browser Settings
Extensions can:

Change your default search engine or homepage

Block or redirect certain websites

Disable built-in security settings

7. Participating in Botnets
Infected browsers can become part of a botnet and be used in:

DDoS attacks

Crypto mining

Spam campaigns

How to Stay Safe:
Only install extensions from trusted developers.

Regularly audit your installed extensions.

Review permissions before installing.

Remove unused or unnecessary add-ons.
